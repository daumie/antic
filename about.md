My name is Dominic Motuka. I will be posting **instruction guides**, **how-to**, **troubleshooting tips** and **tricks** on _Linux_, _database_, _hardware_, _security_ and _web_. My focus is to write articles that will either <u>teach</u> you or <u>help</u> you resolve a problem. 
Over the past three years, I have converted from the occasional *linux newbie* to a Linux evangelist.

I got inspired by various Linux & Open source developers & users. As it follows my ideology that, `Windows of knowledge are wide and open!‚Äù .I am passionate about programming and especially, Ruby and C Programming! Linux has given me everything that I wanted in programming. As Linux is (an) open source operating system, I can study everything about a computer that I want to know.
