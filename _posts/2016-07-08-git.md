**Git** is the most popular version control system that developers use to track and share code, **Git** is  designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. 

The Git feature that really makes it stand apart from nearly every other **SCM** (_Source Control Management_) out there is its branching model.Git allows and encourages you to have multiple local branches that can be entirely independent of each other. The creation, merging, and deletion of those lines of development takes seconds. 

This makes it possible to do things like:

- **_Frictionless Context Switching._** -  Create a branch to try out an idea, commit a few times, switch back to where you branched from, apply a patch, switch back to where you are experimenting, and merge it in. 
- **_Role-Based Codelines._** - Have a branch that always contains only what goes to production, another that you merge work into for testing, and several smaller ones for day to day work. 
- **_Feature Based Workflow._** -  Create new branches for each new feature you're working on so you can seamlessly switch back and forth between them, then delete each branch when that feature gets merged into your main line. 
- **_Disposable Experimentation_**. - Create a branch to experiment in, realize it's not going to work, and just delete it - abandoning the work—with nobody else ever seeing it (even if you've pushed other branches in the meantime).

Notably, when you push to a remote repository, you do not have to push all of your branches. You can choose to share just one of your branches, a few of them, or all of them. This tends to free people to try new ideas without worrying about having to plan how and when they are going to merge it in or share it with others.

- **_Small and Fast_** - Git is fast. With Git, nearly all operations are performed locally, giving it a huge speed advantage on centralized systems that constantly have to communicate with a server somewhere.

- **_Distributed_** - One of the nicest features of any Distributed SCM, Git included, is that it’s distributed. This means that instead of doing a `checkout` of the current tip of the source code, you do a `clone` of the entire repository

- **_Data Insurance._** - The data model that Git uses ensures the cryptographic integrity of every bit of your project. Every file and commit is checksummed and retrieved by its checksum when checked back out. It's impossible to get anything out of Git other than the exact bits you put in.

- **_Staging Area_** - Unlike the other systems, Git has something called the `staging area` or `index`. This is an intermediate area where commits can be formatted and reviewed before completing the commit.
