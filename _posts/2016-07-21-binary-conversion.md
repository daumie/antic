In this section of the Binary Tutorial we will look at how to easily convert between binary, decimal, hexadecimal and octal numbers.

It's important to be able to translate a value from one number system into another. We need to be able to tell when two values represent the same amount. Sometimes, shortcuts become available to us. For instance octal and hexadecimal are often used as shorthand for binary (we'll see why below). Certain systems will only accept values in a certain base as well. Fortunately, switching between number systems is not too difficult.

## Octal to Binary

Converting from octal to binary is as easy as converting from binary to octal. Simply look up each octal digit to obtain the equivalent group of three binary digits. 

|**Octal-**	|**->Binary**	|
|:---:|:---:|
|  1	|	000 |
|  2	|	001 |
|  3 	|	011 |
|  4	|	100 |
|  5	|	101 |
|  6	|	110 |
|  7	|	111	|
 
**Octal** = 345
**Binary** = 011 100 101 = 011100101 binary
